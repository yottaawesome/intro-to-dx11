# Source code for Introduction to 3D Game Programming Using DirectX 11

## Introduction

Unofficial source code repo for Frank D. Luna's book [Introduction to 3D Game Programming using DirectX 11](http://www.d3dcoder.net/d3d11.htm). The source code is reproduced here for reference and remains the copyright of Frank D. Luna.

## Changes

The codebase is being updated over time to migrate it over to use DirectX Math instead of the legacy XNA Math. Solutions are also being updated to retarget them to VS2022 and the latest toolset. References to dxerr and other depracated libraries will be gradually removed.
